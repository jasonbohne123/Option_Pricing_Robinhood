Welcome! This program allows you to compute the **theoretical value** of options you hold in your **Robinhood Portfolio** using Robinstocks and Quantlib!

To get started run `python main.py` in your terminal. After authenticating your Robinhood account, you will be able to see all the current options in your portfolio.

From here, you can price these options using different approximations for the true value. Right now three methods are supported, Black-Scholes, Barone-Adesi- Whaley and Bjerksund-Stensland.

_Disclaimer:_ _Portions of the code are reused from both RobinStocks and QuantLib. This post is not affiliated with any of the mentioned projects or organizations. Use any code at your own risk_
